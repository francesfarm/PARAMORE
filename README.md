# PARAMORE PROTOCOL
PARA is a manual deflationary proof of stake (PoS) token which aims to build a trust-less staking ecosystem. Our protocol offers a liquidity mining powered staking platform to our users; whereby they can stake their PARA tokens, mining MORE tokens in the process. Deposits and withdrawals to the staking platform will incur a 5% burn to the total transactional value of PARA staked by said user.
